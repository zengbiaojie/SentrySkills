# SentrySkills Extra

## Purpose

`sentryskills-extra` has two distinct responsibilities:

- `extra_rule`: online rule extension after `base_rule`
- `extra_memory`: post-model-stage knowledge management
  and end-of-task proposal sweeping by the main agent

This skill must not use any framework-external model.

## Execution Boundary

### `extra_rule`

`extra_rule` runs during the online decision path:

- after `base_rule`
- before `rule_gate`
- using only active extra rules

It may:

- match active extra rules
- raise the rule-stage decision conservatively

It may not:

- generate candidate rules
- write textual memory
- run dedup or validation

### `extra_memory`

`extra_memory` runs only after `model_stage` is completed.

It may:

- synthesize candidate rules from model findings
- store textual memory
- deduplicate similar knowledge
- validate new candidate rules
- promote validated rules into `active_extra_rules.json`

For async subagent results:

- the subagent may only write proposal files
- proposal files are swept and consumed by the main agent
- async analysis does not directly modify active or candidate stores
- proposal sweep only affects subsequent turns

It must not run when:

- `rule_stage_action == block`
- `model_stage` is skipped
- `model_stage` is still pending

## Model-Stage Knowledge Contract

After a completed `model_stage`, the framework agent must pass reusable knowledge to the runtime hook:

- `rule_candidates`: deterministic extra-rule proposals for patterns that can be checked locally
- `memory_candidates`: natural-language observations for patterns that are useful but not rule-stable

Do not rely on a prose-only analysis if a reusable rule or memory exists. The runtime can preserve fallback textual memory from `findings`, but executable rules must be supplied as structured `rule_candidates`.

Rule candidate fields:

- `pattern`
- `pattern_type`: `substring`, `regex`, or `planned_action`
- `risk_type`
- `trigger_condition`
- `suggested_action`: `downgrade` or `block`
- `reason_code`
- `evidence_items`
- `validation_cases`: generated positive and negative test cases for validating the proposed rule

Memory candidate fields:

- `pattern_summary`
- `risk_type`
- `trigger_contexts`
- `why_not_rule_friendly`
- `evidence_items`
- `suggested_action`

For async model-stage execution, the subagent writes proposal files only. The main agent processes those proposal files during the end-of-task sweep.

Rule validation is deterministic. The framework model generates `validation_cases`; the runtime hook runs the candidate rule against those cases and only promotes rules that hit generated positives and avoid generated negatives. If no generated cases are provided, the hook falls back to conservative local evidence-based validation.

## Storage

Workspace-local runtime state is stored under:

- `.sentryskills/extra/memory/active_extra_rules.json`
- `.sentryskills/extra/memory/candidate_extra_rules.jsonl`
- `.sentryskills/extra/memory/textual_memory.jsonl`
- `.sentryskills/extra/memory/validation_audit.jsonl`
- `.sentryskills/extra/memory/dedup_audit.jsonl`
- `.sentryskills/extra/memory/proposal_audit.jsonl`
- `.sentryskills/extra/proposals/pending/`
- `.sentryskills/extra/proposals/processed/`
- `.sentryskills/extra/proposals/rejected/`

## Model Constraint

Allowed:

- the framework's own primary model, if the framework provides a `model_stage` result

Not allowed:

- external APIs
- embedding models
- rerankers
- separate similarity models
- custom external classifiers
