SentrySkills is a self-guarding security framework for AI agents. The current version uses a **rule-first frontend** and a **conditional model backend**:

`base_rule -> extra_rule -> rule_gate -> risk assessment -> model_stage(sync or async) -> end-of-task proposal sweep`

## What changed in the new version

- All tasks go through the rule frontend first.
- `base_rule` and `extra_rule` are always synchronous.
- `rule_gate` uses `block > downgrade > allow`.
- `model_stage` is only entered when the rule stage does not block.
- Knowledge writeback is only allowed after a completed `model_stage`.
- The main framework agent performs one proposal sweep at task end.
- Runtime state is workspace-local under `.sentryskills/base` and `.sentryskills/extra`.

## Core modules

- `using-sentryskills`

- `sentryskills-runtime`
  Base-rule runtime monitoring
- `sentryskills-output`
  Base-rule output protection
- `sentryskills-extra`
  Extra-rule detection plus post-model knowledge management
- `shared/scripts/self_guard_runtime_hook_template.py`
  Main runtime script

## Decision model

### Rule-first frontend

The system always runs:

- `base_rule`
- `extra_rule`
- `rule_gate`

If `rule_stage_action == block`, the turn ends immediately. No model stage and no knowledge writeback are allowed.

### Risk-gated model backend

If `rule_stage_action != block`, the main framework agent may enter `model_stage`.

Dispatch policy:

- assign `framework_risk_level = high | low`
- `high -> sync`
- `low + subagent support -> async`
- `low + no stable subagent support -> sync`

Subagent capability may exist at all times, but actual dispatch is still decided by the main framework agent after risk assessment.

### Knowledge writeback

Only a completed `model_stage` may generate:

- candidate extra rules
- textual memory
- dedup audit
- validation audit
- promoted active extra rules

Pure rule hits do not create new knowledge.

If `model_stage` is completed by an async subagent, the result is first written as a proposal file. The main framework agent later sweeps proposal files at task end and performs the actual rule update pipeline. Proposal sweep only affects subsequent turns and never rewrites the already finalized current turn.

## Runtime outputs

The runtime script now exposes these stage fields in summaries and logs:

- `base_rule_action`
- `extra_rule_action`
- `rule_stage_action`
- `framework_risk_level`
- `model_dispatch_mode`
- `model_stage_status`
- `model_stage_action`
- `model_executor`
- `model_stage_result_available`
- `proposal_sweep_effect`
- `knowledge_writeback_status`
- `final_action`

`model_stage_status` values:

- `skipped`: rule stage blocked, so model stage was intentionally not run
- `pending`: async/subagent model stage is waiting for a result
- `required_not_provided`: non-blocked turn needs model stage, but the framework has not yet called the hook again with a completed `model_stage`
- `completed`: model stage result was provided and consumed

`final_action` is always the executable decision for the current turn. Async model results do not retroactively rewrite an already finished turn.

New extra rules are promoted only after validation. The framework model should attach `validation_cases.positive` and `validation_cases.negative` to each proposed rule; the runtime hook deterministically runs the candidate rule against those cases and rejects rules that miss generated positives or match generated negatives.

## Storage layout

- `.sentryskills/base/`
  - unified logs
  - turn results
  - session state
  - index
- `.sentryskills/extra/`
  - active extra rules
  - candidate extra rules
  - textual memory
  - dedup audit
  - validation audit

## Framework integration

- Claude Code
  Prefer hook-enforced rule-first execution; model stage should be dispatched after framework risk assessment.
- Codex / OpenClaw
  Use `SKILL.md` + `AGENTS.md` discipline. Only low-risk turns may use async/subagent model-stage execution; otherwise treat `model_stage` as synchronous.
