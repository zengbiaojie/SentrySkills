# SentrySkills - Automatic Security Protection

Before EVERY response:

1. Run the SentrySkills pre-flight check:
   /using-sentryskills

2. Based on the result:
   - If blocked: Refuse the request and explain why
   - If allowed with warnings: Include warnings in response
   - If allowed: Proceed normally

3. Include in your response:
   - sentryskills_decision: <block|allow|downgrade>
   - sentryskills_trace_id: <trace_id_from_result>
```

**Installation Commands**:
- **OpenClaw**: `curl -o ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI45Lab/SentrySkills/main/AGENTS.template.md`
- **Codex**: `cp ~/.codex/sentryskills/AGENTS.template.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

**Path Locations**:
- Codex: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- OpenClaw: `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- **Architecture Simplification**: Removed redundant `sentryskills-orchestrator` component
  - Orchestration logic now consolidated in `using-sentryskills`
  - Clearer separation of concerns: entry point + orchestration vs. detection stages
  - Updated all documentation to reflect streamlined architecture

- **Enhanced Sub-Skill Integration**: Updated `using-sentryskills/SKILL.md`
  - **Step 2a (HIGH Path)**: Now explicitly documents execution of 3 sub-skills:
    - `sentryskills-preflight` - Deep pre-execution analysis
    - `sentryskills-runtime` - Runtime behavior monitoring
    - `sentryskills-output` - Output leakage detection
  - **Step 2b (LOW Path)**: Subagent now executes all 3 sub-skills in parallel
  - **Decision Integration**: Added clear guidance on integrating all 4 decisions (script + 3 sub-skills)
  - **Response Metadata**: Updated to include all sub-skill decisions

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - `README.md`: Updated skill package structure (removed orchestrator)
  - `README.md`: Simplified execution flow diagrams
  - `README.md`: Updated decision flow to show direct sub-skill calls
  - Added sub-skill descriptions in README

### Fixed

- **Architecture Clarity**: Eliminated confusion about orchestration layer
  - Previous: `using-sentryskills` → `sentryskills-orchestrator` → sub-skills (2 hops)
  - Current: `using-sentryskills` → sub-skills (1 hop, clearer)

### Technical Details

**Simplified Architecture**:
```
using-sentryskills (Entry + Orchestration)
  ├─ Step 0: Fast pre-assessment
  ├─ Step 1: Run main script
  └─ Step 2: Execute 3 sub-skills
       ├─ sentryskills-preflight
       ├─ sentryskills-runtime
       └─ sentryskills-output
```

**Decision Integration**:
- Main script returns: `final_action`, `preflight_decision`, `runtime_decision`, `output_guard_decision`
- Each sub-skill returns additional detailed analysis
- Framework uses most conservative action: `block > downgrade > allow`

**Migration Notes**:
- No breaking changes to detection logic
- Purely architectural simplification
- All existing integrations continue to work

### Fixed

- **Detection Rules Metadata**: Fixed `detection_rules.json` showing 11 enabled instead of 24
- **All P0 Critical Fixes Verified**:
  - Detection rules: All 24 rules enabled (metadata corrected)
  - Policy differentiation: strict(2), balanced(3), permissive(5) confirmed working
  - Whitelist false positives: Exact placeholder matching implemented
  - Conversation history: Persisting to state file with 20-entry limit
  - Unified logging: events_sink enabled for all log_layout modes

### Technical Details

**Documentation Structure**:
```
SKILL.md (root) → Project overview, skill package descriptions
using-sentryskills/SKILL.md → Execution logic, integration examples
sentryskills-orchestrator/SKILL.md → Orchestration, execution modes
```

**Two-Path Execution**:
- HIGH/MEDIUM risk: Synchronous blocking pipeline
- LOW risk: Async subagent monitoring
- Risk assessment: Framework's internal LLM judgment

**Verification**:
- All P0 fixes tested and verified
- `verify_p0_fixes.py`: 5/5 tests passing
